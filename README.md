The purpose of this project was to take an in-depth look at how multi-classification works and how to work with pycreate to create models to compare and work with. The way we did this was by taking the abalone dataset and focusing on the "sex" as the target value. By taking that as the target value, we created models to test and compare to see which one was the best for the dataset. Throughout the project and until the end, the one that was the best model for the data was  KNeighbours.
